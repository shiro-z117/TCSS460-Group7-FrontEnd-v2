## Beta I Sprint Comments

### Patrick

### Linda Miao

### Shiannel
- Navigating through the whole template code was a lot, but we managed
- Making sure my code worked and figuring out the overall layout and aesthetics of the webpage was a struggle 

### Bao
- I found that I should use npm run start instead of npm run dev for the local deployment

### Shiraz 
- The starter code is very finnicky with modifications and I kind of feel like it would be easier to work from scratch
